## Introduction

FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. This combination ensures that you can create high-performance APIs with minimal effort. FastAPI supports asynchronous programming and provides automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation.

## Features

- **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to its asynchronous capabilities.
- **Easy to Learn**: The framework has a simple and intuitive design, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Fast to Code**: With FastAPI, you can write less code and achieve more.
- **Production-Ready**: FastAPI is designed with production in mind, ensuring that your applications are robust and scalable.
- **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.

## Installation

To install FastAPI, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

You will also need an ASGI server to run your application. Uvicorn is a popular choice:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

## Getting Started

Creating a simple FastAPI application is straightforward. Below is a minimal example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

To run your application, save the code in a file named `main.py` and execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

### Basic API Endpoints

FastAPI allows you to create various types of endpoints easily. Here are some common examples:

#### GET Request

To create a GET endpoint, use the `@app.get` decorator:

```python
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

#### POST Request

To create a POST endpoint, use the `@app.post` decorator:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: bool = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

### Path Parameters and Query Parameters

FastAPI makes it easy to work with both path and query parameters. You can define them in your endpoint functions as shown above.

### Data Validation

FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation. This ensures that the data your API receives is in the correct format.
